# Etch-a-Sketch

This is my The Odin Project of Etch-a-Sketch. I have created a grid with JavaScript that allows you to fill it with colors by hovering your mouse over a grid item. You can also adjust the grid size to your liking by clicking the "Adjust Grid Size" button and inputting the desired grid size.
